This is my project solutions to the projects given in the Deep Learning Nano Degree of late 2018/2019. Please note that I have not completed the course yet.

* Your_first_neural_network.ipynb	- Project #1 solution
* dog_app.ipynb	- Project #2 solution. Classify dogs via own neural network and transfer learning network based on DenseNet121
* determatologyAI.ipynb	- Project Skin Cancer. Classify different skin cancer photos with transfer learning. 
* dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb	- Project TV Script Generation. Train and infer from a LSTM neural network on Seinfeld scripts. Pay special attention to the hyper parameters
* dlnd_face_generation.ipynb - Project Face Generation. Generate Faces using a DCGAN setup on the CelebA dataset (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). Please note the pixelated results coming from the use of ConvTranspose2d.
